Secure Bit Decomposition (SBD) is a cryptographic protocol that is used as a building block in various secure data analysis tasks. Some examples of these tasks are private comparison, secure clustering, and classification.

What I did in this Research Project:

-   Analysed an existing Probabilistic SBD protocol.
-   Created a deterministic SBD protocol which reduces the time complexity of the previous algorithm from O(N) to O(1).
-   Run-time analysis of the existing and newly created algorithm has been done in Python. Paillier Homomorphic Encryption has been used as an ecryption scheme.
